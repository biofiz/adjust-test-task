# Test task from Adjust

Make a simple web app where you can display tweets based on search term provided. It can be a super simple page with input field on the top of it. Results can be shown right under the input.

We expect it to be written in the way so that it could go in production and maintained by your team mates. Its up to you how you want to write it, and libraries you want to use, etc. We expect you to spend on it no more than 3 hours.

This means that if it's not done after 3 hours it is ok to stop and add some comments on what needs to be done to get the whole thing done. It's up to you to spend on the task more than 3 hours, if you want, but we will not expect it, since we understand that you will be doing it parallel to your other commitments.
